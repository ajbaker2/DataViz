### Description
Titled "Income Distributions and Dynamics in America", this set was found through Data is Plural. The goal of this reasearch was to gather more information regarding income disparities, as it includes statistics on "income percentiles, shares, growth rates, persistence, and more for many U.S. demographic groups at national and state levels."

### Estimates
There are a handful of datasets from this research (pctl_of_inc, prop_share, inc_share, inc_change_distributions, transition_matrix), and has information on general demographics such as person/household level, year, geo_var, for a total of around 10 columns. Moreover, each of the above datasets has their own unique columns relevant to the topic at hand, giving a grand total of around 25 to 30 columns. Lastly, the two larger of these datasets (inc_change_distributions and transition_matrix) contain around 2 million rows.

### Description
GRID, or the Global Respository of Income Dynamics provides "individual" (stated on website, but seems to be at the country level) level statistics on income inequality and dynamics. This contains time series data for not only the US but also several other countries, which can be useful if wanting to compare the US to other developed countries.

### Estiamtes
For example, upon downloading all possible data for the U.S., there appears to be one observation/row for each year there is data. Moreover, you can get information on up to 92 different columns, and there are up to 13 countries to collect data for.

### Description
Titled "Personal Income by County, Metro, and Other Areas", this source contains information regarding the personal income of Americans at a number of different levels. Two example datasets here are "Annual personal income and employment by state" and "Annual personal income by county".

### Estimates
For example, the Annual personal income by county data has a dataset for each state, and within this there are statistics for each county regarding income levels and population. There is information like this for each county in the US, and the data covers 1969 to modern day in time series format.
