# Exploring Income Inequality and Economic Wellbeing in the U.S. Since 2005

Andrew Baker

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My current goal is, rather than try to find associations between tax breaks and rises in income inequality, to explore the various aspects of inequality in the US and analyze how it has changed over a 15 year period. The cause of this change was because the data I had acquired did not go back as far as I had hoped, and the data I had dealt with percentiles and demographic shares of those percentiles. I am considering discussing the tax break notion in my final product, as there have certainly been changes to the tax structure since 2005. However, the goal I have in mind now is more exploratory, such as comparing the differing levels of inequality both across states as well as within them. 

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
I am not using mock data, for all the visualizations produced have used real data that I had submitted in week 1. However, I have not used all of the data I had found, for it was not as interesting/useful as I had initially hoped. Moreover, there is another dataset within the IDDA data that I have used thus far that I am interested in using, but I have been struggling to make perfect sense of it. So, instead of spend too much time sifting through it, I decided to put my attention elsewhere for the time being.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.
I have writted a couple sentences for each visualization within the jupyter notebook. The sentences help to explain the graph, its context, and how it fits within the narrative I am trying to build. I tried to make them flow one after the other, beginning with the US as a whole, and then getting into across/within state differences.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
I have not made a final decision on this, but I think infographic is how I want to take this. I imagine a one-pager type of graphic shedding like on the changes in inequality sine '05 (as well as who benefits from this inequality demographic-wise), but I worry about my creative capacity to design the rest of the graphic outside of the visualizations. However, if I could do this how I imagine, the color scheme I have chosen for my visualizations would lend itself well to an infographic regarding the topic of money.
